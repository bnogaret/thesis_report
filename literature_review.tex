Food localization process

circle detection if we make the asumption that the food is in a plate / bowl: 2.2 + 6.3 + \cite{Dehais2015}

color segmentation vs edge segmentation: 11.1 (very limited test)

DCNN: 3.2 + * + 9.1

Food recognition

Using SVM:

Local using BOW: 3.3
gloabal feature:
Color and texture description: 
Spatial pyramid:

Mix of several features:

DCNN: *

Estimate food intake:
