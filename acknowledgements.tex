I am really grateful to Dr. Stefan Rüger, my supervisor for the project, to have proposed this subject. His guidance and valuable advice were particularly helpful to realise the thesis.

Moreover, I would like to thank the University of Technology of Compiègne for giving me the opportunity to study one year in Cranfield University. I would also like to thank Cranfield University for its facilities.

I would like to express my gratitude to M. Kazu Shimoda and Pr. Keiji Yanai of the University of Tokyo that provided enlightenments and further details on their work and datasets.
