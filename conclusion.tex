\chapter{Future work} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this thesis, a localisation and classification method was proposed and it can be used to detect food items of a picture. The localisation process use a novel approach with a pre-trained convolutional neural network to detect salient objects and it currently outperforms the previous works.

One of the possible future area of work is using a more accurate feature descriptor and / or classifier. Compared to the literature, my food recognition is rather inaccurate. Using a pre-trained DCNN for food recognition seems really promising.

Then, it can be added the estimation part that includes a calorie evaluation or a simplified version based on MyPyramid or MyPlate and an application to take pictures and visualize user's record.
