\chapter{Future work} \label{sec:conclusion}

One of the possible future area of work is using a more accurate feature descriptor and / or classifier. Compared to the litterature, my food recognition is rather low. Using a pre-trained DCNN for food recognition seems a promising tool.

It could be also interesting to use multiple segmentation method to combine them.

Then, it can be added the estimation part that include an calorie estimation or a simplified version based on MyPyramid or MyPlate and an application to take picture and visualize user's record.
